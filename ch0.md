# Abstract

Many methods are available for solving vibration-based damage detection problem. Based on co-operative co-evolutionary genetic algorithms providing better performance than conventional genetic algorithms in function optimization, this research intends to solve damage detection problem in truss structures. Seven cases were selected from previous research for simulation and comparison. The results indicates better accuracy in predicting the damage level comparing to previous researches. This algorithm is reliable despite increased number of dimensions and decision variables. For detecting damage with experimental noise, the results are preliminary to explore the variation/difference from the exact prediction and hopefully bridge the gap from numerical study to real application.

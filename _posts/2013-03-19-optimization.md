20130319: Optimization

In optimization problem, large intervals of many variables cost intensive computational effort. GA has been proven [by whom?] to be a very ... technique in ... the objective function because of  ..., ..., .... Vibration meets GA when .... The results to be presented in this paper is ... as compared to ..., ... and .... Therefore, ....
Benefit of Genetic Algorithm
- Speed?
- Accuracy?
- Computational cost?
- Etc.

How do we compare different optimization algorithms? -> Criteria above
What are they?-> evolutionary algorithm
- GA
- Swarm
- SPF, Djikstra
- ...

Design variables [by whom?]
- number of elements: 10 - 1000
- reduction index: 0:100%
- configuration: beam, plate, truss, structure
- convergence criteria
- ...


Why choose Evolutionary Algorithm over common numerical method (in optimization textbooks)?

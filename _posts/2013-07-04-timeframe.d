The scholarship will end in May 2014. 10 months left.
>> 5 for the research, 5 for writing and administrative tasks
This project uses CCGA to solve damage detection in truss structures
Truss can be 2D or 3D >> Search who are working with 3D trusses
Damage factor were assigned numerically, simulated, and compared to the solution by CCGA
* No noise: ( as submitted to iCOME 2013)
* With noise: (2-3%) > exist in real measurement from instrumentation or environment; to be added randomly in simulation >> Search how to include noise

Some cases should be tested with standard GA
* simulation for performance comparison needs 30+ run for statistical validity/repeatablity, although some papers did not mention this practice.

Proposal
* Committee: Dr. Kittipong, Dr. Putha, & Dr. Jitti
* Defense around 3rd week of September (16th-18th)
* [30 SEP - 11 OCT] will be final exam session, the committee might not be available

Writing
* Automatic indexing: table and figure caption feature in MS Word > OK, but need verification with university's formatting guideline
* Citation: manual(direct but need to sort in excel first) or automated tool (Endnote, Zotero, or Reference Manager in Word) >> test zotero integration with Word
* Organization may not not need to follow generic chapter title >> Check with faculty librarians
* Word limit: not necessary, keep to the main point, no descriptive report needed

Programming
* Not necessary to work with C, yet it might be defficult
* Find how to solve problem by including noise into the problem
* Based on Matlab, run existing code for for beam, code truss structure, include the noise, validate with multiple run >> Be clear first with CCGA
* ...

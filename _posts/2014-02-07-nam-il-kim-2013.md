## Summary ##

Objective\: damage detection  
Test case\: Truss 2D and 3D, elastic support  
Method\: 

*  Force / Flexibility method  
*  Singular value decomposition (svd)
*  Micro genetic algorithms (MG) (Khrishnakumar, 1989)
  
How

* use dummy members to replace elastic support
* svd -> ?
* SAP 2000 to verify the calculation of force method
* MGA against displacement method
* compare computational time
 
Parameters

* max-gen = 500
* population = 500
* Xover = 1.0
* mutation - no

Result

* accurately verified by SAP 2000 to solve internal force and displacement
* MGA coverge, good prediction
* faster than displaement method in terms of computational time
 
## So what? ##

* used this structure to test with CCGA, good example for spatial truss

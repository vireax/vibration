## Proposal

Need more clarification and reference

Pages .     Issues    > Feedback < possible answer/solution/todo
<pre><code>

      Surprise > not academic
      Our present day > Should be changed
      > More description a bout CCGA including strength and weakness
      lower computational cost > explain why? + \cite[who] to support
      > add "Scope" section
      Next > not linked to previous < another problem
      Genetic Algorithms > change to lower case
      modification of credit assignment > remove, not necessary to add CCGA-2
      constraints > equality \phi(x) and inequality \psi(x) constraints
      tough optimization > change "tought" to more academic tone
      Big-O notation > remove
      > Detain what is n in O(n log n) or O(n^2)
      NP-hard problems > never mentionned before, need more detail
      Reproduce the following generation > the next population
      > add \cite(melanie1999)
      > listing of programming procedure is not continued < add an introductory paragraph
      Tournament selection > need ref[] or more description < ok + str('because it requires a single pass')
      Genetic operator > need figures to describe the process, if copy from books, cite the source.
      2.3 CCGA > need description of each procedure,
      CCGA-1 > remove '-1', because CCGA-2 is not much in use
      stiffness factor > stiffness factors
      > add a section about vibration in truss structure,
      > explain \phi, [k], [m],
      > include figure of truss structure
      [m]_i > wrong > local vs. global coordinates
      > + figure < ok refer to previous page section about vibration in truss
      > fitness = -f
      > fitness fucntion is different from objective function
      convergence is not known earlier > convergence can be defined earlier
      efficiency .... > not clear
      fitness criteria > max criteria, in this case we are evaluting minimum criteria, minumum [R]
      algo 3.1 line 5 > show relation btw objective function and fitness
      need to be redefined (last line) > ?? < same as as page 8 from source, reference to CCGA-2
      Algo 3.2 line 2 > initialize an arbitrary \beta_i> is this one or many < a set of predicted damage index [\beta_i]
      each case of damage > each case of damage detection or > each case of damage factor
      Algo 3.3 l-1 l.+ random noise > Why? + reference , send reference
      Algo 3.3 l-8 Eval fitness value>?
      Need more detail of parameter settings before the table.

## TSME Icome Conference

* approval received 12 Sept
* ask for funding from Dr. Thongchai
* prepare presentation early

## Defense

* May be after 20th October

## Todo

* Correct proposal
* Send reference: detection with noises
* Meet Dr. Thongchai
* Matlab: clean, make object oriented, add 3D vibration class
* Schedule meating next week 19 Sept  2013, same time is ok

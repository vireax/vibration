## Draft CH1

Based on the concept of biological evolution, the fittest individual survive most and also have the opportunity to reproduce further generation. Certain species may suffer climate changes, migration, food supply, preys, etc. (,) . . .

Computational models of genetic algrorithms represent design variables as individual's chromosomes. The least fit individuals may still reproduce but with lower chance of survival. The fittest members will be kept as elitism. Different selection techniques must always involved in order to ensure randomized sampling of parents population > Selection 1, 2, 3,...

Genetic algorithms has been used in . . .

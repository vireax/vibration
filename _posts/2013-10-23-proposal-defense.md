## Questions:

* Can 3D perform similarly to 2D problme?
* Why choose which method to reject noise?
* Can we determine the displacment?
* Why maxGen not 30 or 40, or other number?
* What is the initial conditionif we need to calculate the displacement, if the structure is under free vibration?
* Can we range error from -3% to 3% for frequencies and mode shpae
* => Determine/infer level of accuracy/precision of the predicted damage


## This <code>\beta => [R] => f => F </code>
* Scienctific method: guess -> test -> validate; if wrong, our guesss is wrong.

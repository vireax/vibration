## Vibration

This project is my on-going master research. Notes, interactive charts, and drafts are posted here to allow people help me point out any mistake in organization and English language before it is ready for submission. I move all notes and drafts from Google Sites to Github because in Jekyll, I can rewrite my own template, markup formula in LaTeX, and embed interactive charts of my result in a single site.

Beside email and by phone, please use the contact form below to correct my writing or ask any question related to this topic.

# INTRODUCTION #

## 1.1 Background

In the area of engineering optimization, problems arise endlessly along every possible solution. At some points, deterministic method cannot sufficiently answer complex problems. Darwinian theory of biological evolution has been adopted for solving various disciplines. Based on the principle of survival of the fittest, genetic algorithms encourage crossover process among the fittest individuals, and thus, surpass random gene mutation of single parents in earlier approach of evolutionary algorithms. (Holland, Goldberg, X S Yang)

Prior to this research, conventional genetic algorithm has been proven to solve successfully damage identification in vibrating bodies such as truss structure and beam elements (Rao, 2004). Among different extensions of genetic algorithms (distributed, parallel, micro, ...), co-operative co-evolutionary approach suggests improved performance in several function optimizations (Potter, 1994). This approach divide the whole population into evolution within and among species. Therefore, co-operative co-evolutionary approach should be able to implement/supplement conventional genetic algorithms in order to obtain better solution in vibration based damage identification problem.

## 1.2 Objectives

This research aims to predict level of damage in truss structure using co-operative co-evolutionary genetic algorithms based on the following specific objectives:  

- To compare the accuracy of damage detection with previous research based on the principle of residual force and CCGA
- To predict damage level while including experimental noise during measurement of modal properties

## 1.3 Scopes ##

- The concept of co-operative co-evolution will be implemented on conventional genetic algorithms only, other family of evolutionary algorithms will not be tested 
- Planar and space trusses will be modeled based on finite element methods to ensure that any error of the solution are only caused by the algorithm itself, not the test subject 
- Damage index of truss element will be numerically simulated, so as the measurement of modal properties of the damaged structure

## 1.4 Significance ##

This research will fill the gap between the integration of theoretical algorithms with application-specific knowledge bases and practical experimental constraints. 

- The accuracy of CCGA over traditional GA allows improved technique in solving optimization problem. 
- Verification with experimental noise allows extension in practical use of the system rathe than computer simulation and laboratory.

## 1.5 Review

### 1.5.1 Vibration based damage detection

In aerospace and civil industry, vibration based damage detection allows continuous health monitoring of the structure. Changes in physical properties result also changes in mechanical properties, which determine therefore product life and the response/characteristics of failure of the whole system at large. To minimize all possible cost/lost due to these changes, engineers should be able to monitor/make use of modal properties of the structure during operation and predict correctly level of damages and warn any sign of failure at the very early stages.

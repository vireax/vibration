title: Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION
---

## Background
* CCGA was proven better than GA
* GA was used to solve vibration based damage detection
* CCGA should be able to solve damage detection problems

## Objectives
* Predict damage 
* Predict damage with experimental noise

## Scope
* Structure: 2D and 3D truss
* Noise: between -3% and +3% in $$ \lambda $$ and $$ \phi $$

## Significance
* higher accuracy
* ready for practical use

## Review
* GA
* CCGA
* Vibration based damage detection
* Uncertainty modeling

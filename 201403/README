## Tests - Objective 1

### 1. 2D Structure (Rao, 2004)

  a. alpha = ones(11,1)
  b. alpha = ones(11,1), alpha(3) = ... , alpha(6) = ...
  c. alpha = ones(11,1), alpha(10) = 0
  
### 2. 2D Structure with elastic support (Kim, 2013)

  a. alpha = ones(16,1)
  b. alpha = ones(16,1), alpha(9) = 0.3
  c. alpha = ones(16,1), alpha(5)= 0.4, alpha(13) = 0.3
  
### 3. 3D Structure with elastic support (Kim, 2013)
  a. alpha = ones(36,1)
  b. alpha = ones(36,1), alpha(13) = 0.4
  c. alpha = ones(36,1), alpha(1) = 0.3, alpha(21) = 0.5
